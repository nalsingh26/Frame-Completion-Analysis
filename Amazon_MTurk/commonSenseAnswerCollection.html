    <h2>Overview</h2>
    The goal is to answer the given question using your commonsense. The questions will often have more than one acceptable answer, but we would like you to provide 
    a single answer as <strong><i>a word or short phrase (in English)</i></strong>. The questions may be trickier than they seem, so please read them carefully!
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <div class = "instructions">
        You will be given a context sentence and a question. The question is generated from the context sentence, but you should <strong>not</strong> answer the questions based on the context sentence.
        We want to collect answers from your commonsense or general knowledge of the world, not by reading the context sentence. To be specific, the answers should meet the following criterias:
        <ul>
            <strong><li>Answers are not in the context sentences.</li></strong>
            <li>Answers are not too general or too specific.</li>
            <li>Answers are using your common sense.</li>
        </ul>
